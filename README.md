# ðŸ’» SurvivorAlarm - Survivor Alarm Team 
## NASA SpaceApp Hackathon

**SurvivorAlarm - Survivor Alarm Team** is a platform that assists the user in managing their health from a gamified interface. During the day, the user enters data such as moments when he ate, drank water, exercised and, based on this data, our algorithm assesses the user's metabolism and monitors various needs for survival.

The **Survivor Alarm Team** team developed the project during the NASA SpaceApp Hackathon, organized by NASA.

The project uses **React Native** framework.
